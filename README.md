# MC3610

Arduino Accelerometer sensor driver for mCube Product MC3610.
==================================================================

The MC3610 is an ultra-low power, low noise, integrated digital output 3-axis accelerometer with a feature set optimized for wearables and the Internet of Moving Things (IoMT) devices.  MC3610 is integrated in a single-chip with the electronics integrated circuit. The internal sample rate can be set from 0.4 to 200 samples/second with a wide usage range, from +/-2g up to +/-16g, and 6bit to 14bit high precision ADC output.
